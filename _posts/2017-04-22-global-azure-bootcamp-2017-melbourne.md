I participated as a speaker in the <a href="https://global.azurebootcamp.net/">Global Azure Bootcamp</a> 2017, Melbourne. The bootcamp was held in around 250 locations across the globe and we were presenting topics on the Dev and IT Pro tracks. My session was about Building "Serverless" Integration Solutions with Azure Logic Apps. Below is the slide deck I presented. I hope it's helpful and you enjoy it.
