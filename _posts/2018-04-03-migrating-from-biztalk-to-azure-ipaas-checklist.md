<h2>Summary</h2>
Business are evolving increasingly fast, and IT can be an enabler or a deterrent of this evolution. IT changes should always bring business value and never compromise core business needs.

As part of becoming more agile, a common concern for many of our customers is the transition from on-premises integration platforms to a cloud or hybrid solution, in particular migrating their BizTalk Server environments to the <a href="https://platform.deloitte.com.au/articles/microsoft-azure-ipaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Azure Integration Platform-as-a-Service (iPaaS)</a>, which is based on Azure Logic Apps.

There are a number of reasons you might want to consider migrating your BizTalk solutions to the Microsoft Azure iPaaS, including:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Enabling or supporting the digital transformation journey</strong>. Azure services, like Logic Apps, Azure Functions and API Management allow you to expose and consume modern APIs, which are key enablers of digital transformation.</li>
	<li><strong>Reducing your OpEx</strong>. Significantly reduce your IT operation and licensing costs by leveraging PaaS and serverless components.</li>
	<li><strong>Gaining Agility</strong>: Azure allows you to deliver business value in weeks, instead of months. Not only because of the tooling but also because of the capabilities of the platform and availability of hundreds of connectors.</li>
	<li><strong>Unlocking new business solutions</strong>: With Azure, new business solutions are possible. From asynchronous messaging of Service Bus to eventing of Event Grid, to smart solutions with Stream Analytics, Cognitive Services and Machine Learning, to monetisation of APIs with API Management, to advanced monitoring and alerting with OMS and Log Analytics, to name a few.</li>
</ol>
With all of that said, supporting your digital transformation leveraging integration can sometimes be challenging. Therefore, it’s imperative you start early, plan thoroughly and implement well to avoid unnecessary complications.
