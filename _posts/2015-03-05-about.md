Hi there! Thanks for stopping by. This is Paco, I am software developer and architect recognised as Microsoft Azure MVP. I started my professional career back in 2001; and since then, I have been working as a consultant. This has allowed me to work for multiple organisations in many different industries and to learn from many different environments.

As part of my journey <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>trying</strong> </span>to make my tiny little "dent in the universe",  I have been blogging and speaking, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>hoping</strong></span> to promote <em>healthier</em> coding practices and more <em>balanced</em> cloud implementations ;)

I am also certified as <em><a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/30aff762-2e03-4090-81fc-dc705ea34109">MCSE: Cloud Platform and Infrastructure</a></em> and currently working as a consultant architecting, building and implementing Enterprise Cloud Applications and Integration Solutions based on Microsoft Azure.

If you are interested in the topics you read here or have have any feedback or questions, I'd love to connect at:
