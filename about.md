Hi there! Thanks for visiting my blog. This is Paco, I am software developer and architect awarded as <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5003116?fullName=Paco%20de%20la%20Cruz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure MVP</a>. I started my professional career back in 2001; and since then, I have been working as a consultant. This has allowed me to work for multiple organisations in many different industries and to learn from many different challenges, environments, and business scenarios.

As part of my journey <em>trying</em> to make my tiny little "dent in the universe",  I have been blogging and speaking, hoping to promote <em>healthier</em> coding practices and more <em>balanced</em> cloud implementations ;)

I am also certified as <em><a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/30aff762-2e03-4090-81fc-dc705ea34109" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MCSE: Cloud Platform and Infrastructure</a></em> and currently working as a consultant architecting, building and implementing Enterprise Cloud Applications and Integration Solutions based on Microsoft Azure.

If you are interested in the topics you read here or have have any feedback or questions, feel free to connect. My details are at the bottom of this page.
